# vcverifier

vcverifier includes in a single binary demo versions of Issuer, Verifier and Wallet (same-device only, for a cross-device wallet please see [VCWallet](https://github.com/hesusruiz/VCWallet)).

This facilitates installation and allows to see how all components fit together and the protocol flows between them.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:hesusruiz/vcverifier.git
```

Before running vcverifier you need to have accessible the endpoints implemented by [VCWaltid](https://github.com/FIWARE/VCWaltid). Please install an run VCWaltid following the instructions there. The endpoints and ports required from vcverifier are preconfigured to match the ones from VCWaltid without any change. If you do require changes, they can be setup in the configuration file in `configs\server.yaml`.

## Running

The first time that you start the vcverifier you have to make sure the database artifacts are consistent. Tou can use the provided Makefile for that or run the command directly:

```
make datamodel
```

The above command has to be executed every time that you modify the database model in the application.

To start vcverifier in development mode, type:

```
go run .
```
